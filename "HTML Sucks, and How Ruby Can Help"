"HTML Sucks, and How Ruby Can Help"

HTML is a mark-up language originonally designed for formatting static-text documents to be passed amongst scientists. Despite the rapid adoption of object-oriented, Turing-complete languages like Ruby to build complex web applications, the front end is still stuck in the past. Here's what we'll cover:

* HTML's tree structure is good for computers, bad for people
* Web-design must remain search-engine friendly
* ERB and the rise of the template
* Ivory (github.com/tyre/ivory) and the future of the object-oriented front-end
* True full-stack development in Ruby

CSS has been slow to adopt even the most basic principles of programming (variables! methods! contstants!), so 'real' developers have eschewed the front end. Let's finally bring everything we've learned with Ruby to the web!
